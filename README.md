# automation_testing
This is my first repository with automation tests for web aplication. In the first iteration I focused on creating working tests. In the next iterations I'll focus on rebuilding the existing tests.
I plan to rebuild locators file that contain XPATH relating to the elements on the page to be more friendly - for example //p[text()='test1234'].
I am also going to add configurations to support tests on other browsers.
And finally, I am going to add more tests for the application and add comments in the code :).
